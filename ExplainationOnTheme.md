Although there are lots of local offline community events organized by many user group leaders, online information is not sufficient for participants to actively coming to community events. Augmented Reality (AR) visualizes objects in offline to smart devices, and smart devices are connected through online. We really think that AR is one of key technologies to bridge between offline and online experiences, and we implemented such bridge through chatbot - chatbot bridges between online and smart devices, and AR bridges between smart devices and offline objects. Our solution help to address current major question and answers with the following ideas:

1. Utilising something intangible (AR) as something useful and not just for effects like making funny pictures.
2. To show that beginners like us have a low barrier of entry to learn AR and use it for the betterment of society, in this case our examples are specific to helping community circles but this could in other positive aspects.
3. We believe that AR is the bridge the real world with the online world.
