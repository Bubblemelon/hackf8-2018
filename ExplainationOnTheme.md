Over our discussion on how we can utilize Facebook technology/features and its platform to help DevC communities and communities alike, we decided on accomplishing this in a unique way (i.e. a path less traveled), and settled on integrating augmented reality (AR). By using 3D visualisation we hope to encourage more interactivity among community individuals e.g. by making location information enjoyable for (physical) offline events. Overall increasing community participation (keep loyal individuals and attract new attendees) and the effect of making community events fun and unique.


1. Utilising something intangible (AR) as something useful and not just for effects like making funny pictures.
2. To show that beginners like us have a low barrier of entry to learn AR and use it for the betterment of society, in this case our examples are specific to helping community circles but this could in other positive aspects.
3. Our real world being offline help
