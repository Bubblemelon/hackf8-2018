## Inspiration
Yeongrak Choi is a DevC (Facebook Developer Circles) lead in Seoul, Korea. He has experiences organizing ~70 community events including DevC local events in Korea, and really wanted to help users to more easily engage in offline community events. Cheryl has cool experiences with developing 3D games, and Yeonsoo is very eager to realize software idea with beautiful designs. When we discussed how Facebook technology and platform help for communities, we have finally figured out that augmented reality (AR) benefits much cool and better visualization on location information for offline events so that participants can more actively come to and engage in community events.

## What it does
- Realizing augmented reality for bridging offline community events and online information related to the events
  - Visualization of where the event venue is through augmented reality
  - Detailed visualization of where the event room is inside the event venue building through augmented reality
  - Helping to find empty seats with augmented reality technology
- Connecting those augmented reality technology through `Chatbot` (Facebook Messenger Platform)

## How we built it
- We implemented augmented reality using [Facebook AR Studio](https://developers.facebook.com/products/ar-studio).
- To connect augmented reality and chatbot, we created a [Facebook page as a prototype](https://www.facebook.com/DevC-Meetup-304462963421738/), and registered a chatbot to [Facebook developers](http://developers.facebook.com/).
- We defined very helpful use cases which help participants to more engaging in offline community events, and realized those idea into chatbot questions & answers

## Challenges we ran into
- `Facebook AR Studio` is so cool but more great functionalities are currently in beta and there are still some bugs in current AR Studio.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Realizing AR technology
- Really helpful to community events

## What we learned
- AR is really cool!

## What's next for community-events-with-ar
- Waiting for more cool functionalities in AR Studio currently supported in beta
- Applying to our local events
